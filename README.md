# ⌚ Scrape-Watch-Data-from-Myntra-Using-Selenium-and-BeautifulSoup


## Objective 🎯
The goal of this project is to automate the process of data scraping from the Myntra website and extract useful information about watches. By using Selenium, we automate the browsing and interaction with the website. BeautifulSoup is then used to parse the HTML and extract the desired data, which is subsequently saved in a CSV file.

## 🚀 Usage
### Selenium Script
1.**Automate Myntra Website:**
The first script uses Selenium to automate the Myntra website, navigating through the watch listings and saving the page's HTML content into a file named -
[myntra_watches_all_combined.html.](https://github.com/Susmita1703/Scrape-Watch-Data-from-Myntra-Using-Selenium-and-BeautifulSoup/blob/main/use%20of%20selemium%20to%20get%20html%20file%20of%20myntra%20watches.ipynb)

### BeautifulSoup Script
2 **Extract Data from HTML:**
The second script uses BeautifulSoup to parse the saved HTML file. It extracts product details such as product IDs, watch names, brand names, prices, and ratings."This file contains the code used to scrape data from the HTML file using BeautifulSoup."

## 📊 Results
The extracted data includes the following columns:
<ul style="animation: fadeIn 3s;">
  <li>ID</li>
  <li>Watch name</li>
  <li>Brand name</li>
  <li>Discount percent</li>
  <li>Ratings</li>
  <li>People rate</li>
  <li>Discount price</li>
   <li>Original price</li>
</ul>

The data is stored in CSV file named  [watches_data.csv](https://github.com/Susmita1703/Scrape-Watch-Data-from-Myntra-Using-Selenium-and-BeautifulSoup/blob/main/myntra%20watchess%20details.csv) for easy access and further analysis.
